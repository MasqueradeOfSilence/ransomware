Basic, isolated ransomware for IT 567. Done for educational purposes only :)

ransomware.py only infects the files inside of infection. 

The backup_files are there just in case. 

Trying to encrypt a GIF tends to overwhelm Python's Fernet library a little bit, so I wouldn't recommend trying it, and as a result the GIF is kept outside of the infection directory.
